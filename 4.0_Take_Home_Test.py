HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: ______________________


  1. What is missing from this code?
     
     midichlorians = float(input("Enter midichlorian count: ")
     if midichlorians > 10000:
         print("You have serious Jedi potential")
     else:
         print("Jedi, you will never be.")

  2. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it?
     
     user_input = input("R2D2 is a: ")
     print("A. Droid")
     print("B. Storm Trooper")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")

  3. There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. 
     
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")

     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3

  6. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong?

  7. Look at the code below. Write your best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5

 10. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the force sensitivity variable according to the character the user selects.
