NUMBER ANALYSIS PROGRAM
-----------------------
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then analyzes it to determine if it is:
1.) odd or even
2.) positive, negative or zero
3.) inclusively between -100 and +100

A small report will then be printed. Use the following to test your program:

In: 32  
Out:  Test 1: Even
      Test 2: Positive
      Test 3: Inclusive

In: -123  
Out:  Test 1: Odd
      Test 2: Negative
      Test 3: Exclusive

Number=float(input("what is your number?"))

if Number >= -100 and Number <= 100:
    print("this number is inclusive")
elif Number >100 or Number <-100:
    print("This number is not inclusive")
